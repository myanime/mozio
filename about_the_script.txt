The main part is geojson_parser.py everything else is the REST server. There is a readme.txt file with the installation instructions for the script. And also a setup script

I have set up a demo server at http://mediapartners.tk/ you can make requests to it like this:

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"location" : [34.15, 44.48, 34.15, 44.49, 34.17, 44.49, 34.17, 44.48, 34.15, 44.48]}' http://mediapartners.tk/

-or-
http http://mediapartners.tk/
(needs httpie installed)

You can also use the HTML API interface:
to post and batch get all:
http://mediapartners.tk/

Paste this into the box and press post
{
    "name" : "Crimea Deliveries",
    "email" : "crimea@whitehouse.com",
    "phone_number" : 456987,
    "language" = "russian",
    "location" : [34.15, 44.48, 34.15, 44.49, 34.17, 44.49, 34.17, 44.48, 34.15, 44.48]
}

-or-

{
    "location" : [34.15, 44.48, 34.15, 44.49, 34.17, 44.49, 34.17, 44.48, 34.15, 44.48]
}


to do get, update, delete:
http://mediapartners.tk/1 

The server is at gcloud, it is trivial to set it up on AWS, I didnt do it on AWS for financial reasons. 

The POST and Get functions works more or less as expected, you can update primitavely by overriding the "geojson_object" field. 

I would like to work on you projects but to get something like this working properly, I would say 2-3 weeks. Sometimes you can spend a day or two just trying to solve some relatively simple issues. I am willing to work cheap, but your timeframe and expectations for this task were a little unrealistic.
